#ESP32 CCTV Camera Access
Warning: This project is for educational purposes only. Attempting to access a CCTV camera without the owner's consent or knowledge is illegal and unethical. Please respect the privacy and security of others' devices.

Overview: This project demonstrates how to access a CCTV camera using an ESP32 board, without knowing the camera's username and password. This is not a recommended or approved practice, and you should only use this project for legitimate purposes, such as accessing your own camera or with the explicit permission of the camera's owner.

Hardware Requirements:

ESP32 board
Wi-Fi module (built-in or external)
CCTV camera with Wi-Fi connectivity
Software Requirements:

ESP32 Arduino core or MicroPython
Wi-Fi library for ESP32
HTTP or RTSP library for ESP32 (depending on the camera's protocol)
Setup:

Connect your ESP32 board to your computer using a USB cable.
Install the ESP32 Arduino core or MicroPython on your computer.
Upload the provided code to your ESP32 board.
Connect to the camera's Wi-Fi network using the ESP32's Wi-Fi module.
Identify the camera's IP address using tools like nmap or arp-scan.
Update the code with the camera's IP address and protocol (HTTP or RTSP).
Code:

The code is provided in two versions: Arduino and MicroPython.
